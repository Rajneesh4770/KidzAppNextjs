                1.2 &nbsp; Your use of the App and your Purchase of any of the
                Tickets or bookings offered via our App is subject to these
                Terms and by placing an order for any Tickets you agree to be
                bound by them. You should print a copy of these Terms for future

                App is governed by our privacy policy. Your use of the App
                implies that you have also read and accepted the Privacy Policy.
                Please email us at info@kidzapp.com if you have any questions or
                concerns. Any mention of the word Tickets refers to any Tickets

                1.3 &nbsp; We reserve the right to change these Terms from time
                to time by changing them on the App, although no such change
                will affect any Purchase you have already made with us. Your
                continued use of the App and any new Purchases will be bound by
                the new Terms. These Terms were last updated on March 20, 2019.

              <p>
                1.4 &nbsp; As a consumer, nothing in these Terms will prevent

                benefit of your legal rights provided under general UAE law

              <p>
                2.1 &nbsp; To use the App and make any Purchases, you must be 18
                or over. By continuing to use the App and agreeing to these
                Terms you are representing to us that you are 18 and we can rely
                on this representation.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.2 &nbsp; The App and the Events offered on the App are only
                directed at people who access the App and make Purchases in the
                UAE. We do not represent that any Events are suitable outside
                the UAE and you should be careful to satisfy yourself of a
                Event’s suitability to your circumstances (such as considering
                your travel arrangements to/from the event because unless this
                is expressly stated as part of the Event, it is not included as
                part of the Purchase). If you choose to use the App or make a
                Purchase outside the UAE you do so at your own initiative.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.3 &nbsp; We grant you a limited licence to use the App to
                access and use our services for your own personal and
                non-commercial use, provided that you comply fully with these
                Terms (e.g. you must not re-sell the Tickets).

              <p>
                2.4 &nbsp; We reserve the right to prevent you using the App or
                making Purchases, however we will honour Purchases already made,
                unless you have not complied with these Terms or we are unable
                to because of circumstances outside our control. For more on

                3.1 &nbsp; We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or
                error-free operability of the App. There may be times when
                certain features, parts or content of the App, or the entire

              <h2>4. Registering a Kidzapp account</h2>
              <p>
                4.1 &nbsp; Why register? To put simply, if you don’t register an
                account, you won’t be able to make any Purchases. This is
                because you need an account in order to view your Purchased
                Tickets, redeem them (if required), view your past Purchases,
                and modify your preferences to name a few. We reserve the right
                to decline a new registration or cancel your account at any time
                (including if you don’t provide us with a valid e-mail address
                that is personal to you, or if you don’t provide us with a
                correct name and surname).
              </p>
              <p>
                4.2 &nbsp; To register an account you will need to fill out a
                form on the mobile app or online. You warrant that the
                information you input is true, complete and accurate. You will
                promptly inform us of any changes to such information (you can
                do this by updating your account details at any time). The
                personal information you give us is governed by our privacy
                policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.3 &nbsp; In order to register and access your account, you
                will need to choose a password. It is important you keep this
                password confidential because you are entirely responsible if
                you do not maintain the confidentiality of your password to a
                reasonably expected standard and Purchases are made via your
                account. Let us know as soon as you become aware there has been
                a breach of security and we will suspend your account. You agree
                that any person who you directly or implicitly permit to use
                your password (implicitly, for example, because you do not log
                out of your account and another person uses your device to make
                Purchases or you write your password on a noticeboard in your
                home and a family member then uses it to gain access to your
                account) is authorised to act as your agent to use the App and
                make Purchases via your account. You will not be responsible to
                pay for Purchases made after you have notified us of a password
                change or that security has been compromised.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.4 &nbsp; One individual user is allowed to register only one
                account on the App. You warrant that you will not create
                fraudulent accounts. You also warrant that you will not use any
                fraudulent activities to generate unfair Reward Credits in the
                App to be applied to you (for instance, you will not redeem your
                own invitation code with a different account of yours).
